# E-commerce analysis

I analyse data from the new E-commerce company VS Electronics, which launched in December 2018. 
As the name suggests, the company focuses on electronic products. 
The goal was to analyse data collected over the period December 2018 â€“ November 2019 to gather insights into the business and suggest KPIs for future growth. 

- This project comprises three parts. 

### 1) data wrangling for SQL
- Preparing the data to be exported as tables to an SQL database for further queries

### 2) EDA
- The analysis can be divided broadly into two parts
- Part 1 analyses user behaviour and customer buying patterns
- Part 2 focuses more specifically on metrics for ecommerce.  

### 3) k-means clustering
- Classification of customers in the database into groups.
